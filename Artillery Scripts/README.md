This script was made by request from someone online. <Br/>
These scripts take advantage of Table Top Simulator's physics engine to 'fire' a projectile a set distance and make a splash.<Br/><Br/>
For the torpedo script, the torpedo projectile moves a set distance every time the turn button is clicked until it runs into something or the distance is reached. <Br/><Br/>
I made this script a long time ago, and am just now uploading it.
