This script was made for someone online by request. 
I worked with them for a few days collaborating to script the game they already made into Table Top Simulator. 

I made this script a long time ago, but am just now uploading it as a record of my work.
There is no workshop url currently for this game.

Most scripts here were writen by me, some smaller functions like waitFrames(frames) (and the only one I can think of) were copied with permission.
